The other day I had a discussion with my coworker. I told her that I had
spent two hours in the weekend on translating an open source app. <!--more-->She
couldn't see the use of it and that's why I explained:

1.  Localised apps make them more accessible to a broad audience.
2.  Providing translations is a great way to become a part of the
    community of a project.
3.  It is great to contribute to the programs you use everyday for free.
4.  You get to dive deep in the app and learn more about parts you maybe
    never used.
5.  It won't cost you much time.
6.  Translating is fun!

Some of these points have been flogged to death, I am aware of that.
Still it is nice to give a concise overview.
